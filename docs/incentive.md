Suppose you have a ton of images acquired over the years, e.g.:

* Pictures you took through the Facebook app on your phone
* Pictures you got sent through WhatsApp
* Pictures you took on an ancient old phone, which didn't do metadata very well
* Pictures from a fancy DSLR, which you managed through iPhoto
* Pictures which you downloaded when you cancelled an account somewhere
* ...

This will put you in a spot where you have pictures stored all over the place and which:
* Lack metadata
* Have duplicates
* Are stored in different formats

And also, pictures:
* Which you didn't take yourself, but want to keep
* Which you didn't take yourself and want to get rid of

This leaves you with the task of doing the following:
* Figure out if images have duplicates
* Figure out when pictures were taken
* Figure out who took the picture in the first place
* Figure out where pictures were taken

And then:
* Be able to pick out duplicates and consolidate the lot
* Move superfluous images somewhere else
* Separate the received ones from the ones you took yourself
* Put your other images somewhere else

Basically:
* Throw away the crap
* Store all the images you received in one place
* Store all the images you took yourself in another
* Order all the images by time and place
* Ensure all images have the proper metadata

So... How do we go about doing this?
